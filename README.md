# text_analysis

Please ensure that before downloading the text_assistant.py file, that you download the requirements.txt file and the text_utilities.py file. The text_utilities file contains all of the functions necessary for the assistant to create embeddings and also find the optimal amount of clusters. Currently there is only one data set, huffington_post.csv that is being used to evaluate the data. However, more is coming up soon! Thank you for your patience!
